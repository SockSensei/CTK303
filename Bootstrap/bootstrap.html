                    <p>I put together all of the material for what I make, though on occassion I will borrow inspiration from various other works of art, or in the case of my YouTube presence, will use footage about a topic as visual aid.</p>

                    <p>With over 7 years of experience I've become fluent in all forms of editing software. I find joy in watching how video can transform upon a timeline just as paint can on a canvas.</p>

                    <p>Using my knowledge of applications like photoshop I've digitally designed a few merchandise items for purchase of fans of my work. I drew inspiration for this one partiularly from an older anime, referencing the robotic nature of a character in the container for my logo.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-3">Short Films</h4>
                    <p>I've put together two short films in the past year, each was a learning experience I'll take into the next. The end product for the second film made me feel much better about our ability as creators after the first one turned out weak in our opinion.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-3">YouTube Career</h4>
                    <p>I've been using YouTube as a platform to create on for 3, almost 4 years. I shared my love for anime through careful analysis of the themes and philosophies behind a given piece of work. It's turned into a successful career for me, and what I spend a majority of my time creating on.</p>
